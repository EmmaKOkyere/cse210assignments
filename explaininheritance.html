        <h1>What is inheritance and why is it important?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit properties
        and behaviors from an existing class. This principle promotes code reusability and a establishes a natural hierarchy
        between classes, which can reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
    </p>
    <p>
        One major benefit of inheritance is that it allows for polymorphism. This means that, a simgle function can operate on different
        classes through a common interface, enabling more flexible and dynamic code. For example, if you have a base class called <i>Shape,</i>
        you can create subclasses like <i>Circle</i> and <i>Rectangle,</i> each with its own methods to calculate area while still being
        able to use a common method to display the shape.
    </p>
    <p>
        An application of inheritance is applied through my code from the Activity base class. Which provides common mthods for all derived
        classes like <i>BreathingActivity, listingActivity, and ReflectionActivity.</i> This structure promotes code reusability and allows for easy
        expansion. Each derived class can implement its specific behavior while sharing common functionality, making the application organized and maintainable.

        <i>class Program
            {
                static void Main(string[] args)
                {
                    Activity activity = null;
            
                    Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the Mindfulness App!");
                    Console.WriteLine("Select an activity:");
                    Console.WriteLine("1. Breathing Activity");
                    Console.WriteLine("2. Reflection Activity");
                    Console.WriteLine("3. Listing Activity");
                    Console.WriteLine("4. Meditation Activity"); // New option
            
                    string choice = Console.ReadLine();
                    switch (choice)
                    {
                        case "1":
                            activity = new BreathingActivity();
                            break;
                        case "2":
                            activity = new ReflectionActivity();
                            break;
                        case "3":
                            activity = new ListingActivity();
                            break;
                        case "4":
                            activity = new MeditationActivity(); // Handle new activity
                            break;
                        default:
                            Console.WriteLine("Invalid choice.");
                            return;
                    }
            
                    activity.Execute();
                }
            }</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        My code implements a mindfulness app that offers different activities for relaxation and reflection.
        Through inheritance, the Activity base class provides shared methods for starting and ending activities, 
        while subclasses like BreathingActivity, ListingActivity, and ReflectionActivity define their unique behaviors. 
        This structure allows users to select an activity and engage with it, promoting code reusability and simplifying future expansions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, inheritance is a powerful tool in OOP that enhances code efficiency and fosters a logical structure, making it
         easier to manage and expand applications.
