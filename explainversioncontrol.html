    <p> 
        Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes made to files over time by individuals or teams.<br>Version control
        is also a system that keeps historical record of every modification, that allows users to return 
        <br>to previous versions and make comparisons of modifications and collaborate effectively. In the software development <br>world,
        this system of version control is vital and necessary. This is because, it manages changes across various code <br>versions, promoting
        consistency and  accountability among team members. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One vital benefit of version control is the opportunity it gives to enhance collaborations. For example, when in a software <br>development team,
        several developers can work on different features or bug fixes at the same time. With a version control <br>system like Git, each developer is able to create 
        branches to  work independently without interfering with the main codebase. <br>after their work is completed, each developer can merge back their changes into the 
        main branch and resolve any conflict <br> that may occur. This approach fosters and maintain the integrity of the project in addition to it's productivity in collaborations.
        <br> 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, a good example  of a Git command that showcases version control is the "git commit" command. This command <br> takes a snapshot of the current state of the project,
        allowing developers to save their changes along with a brief description. <br> every commit serves as a reference point in the project's history, helping to track progress and understand 
        the evolution <br> of the codebase. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, version control is a vital practice in today's softaware development world. It promotes collaboration, improves <br> accountability and maintains the integrity of the code 
        through a systematic tracking of changes.
