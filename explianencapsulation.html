        <h1>What is encapsulation and why is it important?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that combines data "attributes" and
        the functions "methods" that work with that data into a single unit, typically a class.
        This means that the internal state of an object is hidden form outside access and can only be changed or viewed
        through specific methods. This helps in safeguarding an object's integrity by preventing
        external interference and misuse. As we consider encapsulation important in the programming world, one
        significant benefit is <em>data protection</em>. By limiting access to an object's internal state and exposing
        what is necessary,
        we can maintain and manage the data more effectively and minimize the chances of unintended interactions that
        may occur and result in invalid states. This way of approach makes the code simpler to maintain, understand and
        debug.
    </p>
    <p>
        Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in software development. One common application is in managing class
        properties. For example, in a class that represents a bank account, we might limit direct access to the account
        balance and
        instead offer methods for depositing or withdrawing funds. This approach ensures that the balance cannot be
        altered directly.

    <p class="myprogram">
        public class Reference
        {
        private string _book;
        private int _chapter;
        private int _verse;
        private int _endVerse;

        public Reference(string book, int chapter, int verse)
        : this(book, chapter, verse, 0)
        {
        }

        public string GetDisplayText()
        {
        return _endVerse > 0 ? $"{_book} {_chapter}:{_verse}-{_endVerse}" : $"{_book} {_chapter}:{_verse}";
        }
        }
    </p>
    <p>
        In my code, the fields `_book`, `_chapter`, `_verse`, and `_endVerse` are private. This means they can not be
        accessed directly from outside the class, which helps keep the data safe. The `GetDisplayText` method is public,
        allowing controlled access to the data. It returns the reference information in a formatted way without letting
        outside
        code change the private fields.This encapsulation ensures that the `Reference` class's internal state can only
        be changed through its methods, which promotes data integrity.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, encapsulation is crucial as it protects an object's state, enhances code maintainability,
        and promotes better organization within software applications.
