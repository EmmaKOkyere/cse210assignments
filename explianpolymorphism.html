        <h1>What is polymorphism and why is it important?</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
        Polymorphism is a core principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that enables methods to behave differently
        depending on the object they are working with, even if those methods share the same name.The term comes from the
        Greek words "poly," meaning "many," and "morph," meaning "forms." Essentially, this allows a single interface to
        represent various underlying data types, often achieved through method overriding or method overloading.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we consider polymorphism important in the programming world, One of the key advantages of polymorphism is
        that
        it boosts flexibility and maintainability in code. Because polymorphic functions can work with objects from
        various
        classes, developers can create more generic and reusable code. This feature helps minimize redundancy and
        simplifies
        the process of adding new functionalities without needing to modify existing code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Polymorphism is widely utilized in frameworks and libraries, enabling developers to scale applications
        effectively.
        For example, in a GUI framework, you might have a draw() method that is overridden by different shapes such as
        Circle,
        Square, and Triangle. Each shape can implement its own drawing logic, yet they can all be managed through the
        same interface.

    <p class="myprogram">
        using System;
        using System.Collections.Generic;

        namespace EternalQuest
        {
        // Main program class to manage goals
        class Program
        {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        List<Goal> goals = new List<Goal>
                {
                new SimpleGoal("Run a marathon"),
                new EternalGoal("Read scriptures"),
                new ChecklistGoal("Attend the temple", 10)
                };

                // Simulating goal achievements
                goals[0].RecordEvent(); // Complete Simple Goal
                goals[1].RecordEvent(); // Record for Eternal Goal
                goals[2].RecordEvent(); // Record for Checklist Goal
                goals[2].RecordEvent(); // Record again for Checklist Goal

                // Displaying all goals and their status
                Console.WriteLine("\nCurrent Goals and Points:");
                foreach (var goal in goals)
                {
                goal.DisplayGoal();
                }

                // Final Checkpoint
                Console.WriteLine("\nTotal Points:");
                int totalPoints = 0;
                foreach (var goal in goals)
                {
                totalPoints += goal.GetPoints();
                }
                Console.WriteLine($"Total Points Earned: {totalPoints}");
                }
                }
                }
    </p>
    <p>
        In my code, The **EternalQuest** program demonstrates polymorphism by managing different types of
        goals—`SimpleGoal`,
        `EternalGoal`, and `ChecklistGoal`—as `Goal` types. This allows methods like `RecordEvent()`, `DisplayGoal()`,
        and
        `GetPoints()` to be called without knowing the specific goal type. When achievements are recorded, the
        appropriate
        method for each subclass is invoked, updating their progress. This approach simplifies code management and
        allows
        for easy addition of new goal types in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, polymorphism in C# is essential for building flexible and adaptable applications, allowing
        developers
        to write code that works smoothly with different data types.
