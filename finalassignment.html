        <h1>Explain Progamming with Classes?</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <H1>Abstraction</H1>
    <p>
        <em>Abstraction</em> is the principle of hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of an object.
        It lets programmers interact with objects through a simplified interface, making systems easier to understand and use.
    </p>
     <p>
        <em>In my journal program,</em> I effectively applied abstraction in the Entry class, which represents a journal entry with attributes 
        such as Prompt, Response, and Date. Users of the Entry class do not need to understand the internal workings of the ToFileString method. 
        They only need to know that calling entry.ToFileString() will provide a formatted string suitable for file output.
     </p>
        <p>
        <em>Using abstraction</em> in the Entry class enhances the program's flexibility for future changes. It encapsulates implementation details, 
        allowing modifications to the ToFileString method without affecting users. This simplifies interactions, enabling users to focus on
        functionality rather than complex implementation. Maintenance becomes easier, as changes can be made within the method without altering 
        external code. Additionally, abstraction supports the creation of subclasses or extensions, promoting adaptability and ensuring the program remains efficient.
       </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <H1>Encapsulation</H1>
    <p>
        <em>Encapsulation</em>is the practice of grouping data and the methods that manipulate that data into a single unit, usually a class. It limits direct access to 
            certain components of an object, safeguarding its internal state from external changes.
    </p>
     <p>
        <em>In my program,</em> I applied encapsulation by making fields like _name, _age, and _email private within a User class. This design prevents
           direct access to these fields from outside the class, ensuring that the data remains secure. To provide controlled access, I implemented public methods such as GetUserInfo() 
           and UpdateEmail(). This way, users can retrieve and modify the data safely without compromising the integrity of the internal state.
     </p>
        <p>
        <em>Using encapsulation</em>  enhances the program's flexibility for future changes in several ways. First, it allows for changes to the internal implementation 
           without affecting external code. For instance, if I decide to change how the user data is stored or validated, I can do so within the class without requiring
           updates to the code that interacts with it. Additionally, this approach makes it easier to maintain and debug the program, as all data handling is centralized within the class methods.
           Overall, encapsulation promotes adaptability and ensures that the program can evolve while maintaining data integrity.
       </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <H1>Inheritance</H1>
    <p>
        <em>Inheritance </em>is a mechanism that enables one class (the subclass) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (the superclass). 
            This fosters code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes.
    </p>
     <p>
        <em>In my mindfulness app,</em> I utilized inheritance by creating a base class called Activity that includes shared methods for 
            starting and ending activities. Subclasses such as BreathingActivity, ListingActivity, and ReflectionActivity each implement their unique behaviors
            while inheriting the foundational features from the Activity class. This design allows users to easily select and engage with various activities.
     </p>
        <p>
        <em>Using inheritance</em> enhances the program's flexibility for future changes in several ways. It promotes code reusability, as common functionalities 
            are centralized in the Activity class, minimizing redundancy. If I need to introduce a new activity type, I can simply create a new subclass that inherits 
            from Activity, ensuring consistency while adding new features. This structure makes it easier to maintain and expand the app, allowing for seamless integration 
            of additional activities without disrupting existing code.
       </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <H1>polymorphism</H1>
    <p>
        <em>Polymorphism</em> is the ability to treat different classes as if they are instances of the same class using a common interface. This means that methods 
            can be called on objects of various types, with each object executing its own version of the method.
    </p>
     <p>
        <em>In my EternalQuest program,</em> I applied polymorphism by managing various goal types—SimpleGoal, EternalGoal, and ChecklistGoal—as instances of a common
            Goal type. This design allows methods like RecordEvent(), DisplayGoal(), and GetPoints() to be called on any goal without needing to specify the exact type. 
            When achievements are recorded, the correct method for each subclass is automatically invoked, updating their progress accordingly.
     </p>
        <p>
        <em>Using polymorphism </em>enhances the program's flexibility for future changes by simplifying code management. Since all goal types 
            share a common interface, I can easily add new goal types without modifying existing code. This approach also makes it easier to maintain and extend the 
            functionality of the program, as new goals can be integrated seamlessly while adhering to the established structure.
       </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        In summary, using the four principles of Programming with Classes—abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, I built a more organized, maintainable,
        and flexible codebase for my projects. Each principle helps the program evolve while reducing the chances of errors.
